This bundle consists of the following software:

cw         - A morse generator, for PulseAudio or OSS. You need to compile it 
           first (just type 'make'). 

kochwords  - Common CW words trainer. Enter the words you hear, as fast as 
           possible. If you're quick enough and thus prove your skill, 
           the level will raise and there will be more words.

           The scoring system is adjusted for an average touch typer. 'Hunt &
           peck' typers or professional touch typers may want to tweak the
           appropriate variable in the source code.

           Run it with the '-h' flag to access the help.

morsechef  - A game to improve your morse copying skills. Choose 4 appropriate
           ingredients among those proposed.

           Run it with the '-h' flag to access the help.
